# shop-page

The reason why I wanted to create a pharmaceutical page is because I have my background in the pharmacy and I wanted to do something that has been a part of my daily life during many years. I love spreading knowledge about medication use and help people to have a better understanding in how to use their medicines. This project is only one week old so I have not had enough time to add many medicines yet, only a few otc drugs so far. It has been taking some time since I do not have an endpoint for all the drugs so I had to create my own endpoint which is time consuming. I also wanted this page to be available for everyone so I made it live by deploying it with firebase Hoisting. Open this link to see my page. https://shop-page-c4c0e.web.app/ I have used React with typescript in this project and I have also written a few unit tests ( https://github.com/elaheesk/your-pharmacist/blob/main/your-pharmacist/src/App.test.tsx ) for my application.




I have deployed my project with firebase so it is live.

*Before starting the project run the below commands: npm install
