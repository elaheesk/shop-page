					<p className="pDescription">
						I embraced the flexibility of online learning  and  thorough the
						Frontend developement Programme at Ec Utbildning, I have studied
						during weekdays while been working at pharmacy on the weekends. I
						have good skills in HTML5 and CSS, React js, Redux, Typescript,
						Material Ui, UX-technique and NodeJS, and some basic knowledge in
						GitHub. Therefore I am looking for internships to start immediately
						and I am confident that my positive attitude contributes to a
						positive environment. The fact that I put all my effort and really
						obsess about solving the problem at hand, has so far helped me
						exceed my own expectations and personal goals since I started
						coding. Looking forward to hear from you.
